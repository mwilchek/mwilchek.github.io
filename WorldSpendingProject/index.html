          The purpose for this project is to visualize data using the Google Visualization API and advancing data visualization techniques. 
          This individual project will use country education, healthcare and military spending data as the foundation for the following visualizations. Using 
          creative plots on data, important insights can be drawn from complex data that ultimately tell a story.

        <h2>Overall Spending Summary</h2>
        <p class="lead"> Before diving deep into each category of spending, it's important to first see how each compares together to gain a sense 
          of the overall analysis. Below is an executive overiew of all the Healthcare, Education, and Military spending data:
        </p>
        <!-- Enter Histogram of Spending Data of Top 10 Countries -->
        <div id="spending_summary_div" style="width: 900px; height: 500px;"></div>
        <div style="text-align: center">
          <p class="small"><i>Note: Healthcare data goes up to 2018, Military data to 2019, and Education data to 2016 </i></p>

          <button class="button button3" id="b2">Remove a Category</button>
        </div></br>
        <p>At first, we can immediately notice that the categories of Education and Military have the highest average spending. The U.S. and China have 
          the largest average of spending for both Education and Military. As we interact with the graph and drill down to see the significant lower 
          distribution of Healthcare, we notice that the U.S. still is the largest, but China is one of the lowest in all the countries.

        <h2>Health & Education Spending Vs. Military Spending</h2>
        <p class="lead">Healthcare and Education are critical for a growing country. They can be considered as part of basic needs for people. However, 
            security and recognition of sovereignty from other nations is also important. Let's next compare spending of Healthcare and Education versus 
            Military spending data:
        </p></br>
        <!-- Enter Comparison Viz for Health & Education Spending Vs. Military Spending -->
        <div id="spending_summary_othersMil_div" style="width: 900px; height: 300px;"></div></br>
        <p>The combined distribution of Healthcare and Education spending makes up 50% or more of the total average spending of all categories. As a citizen 
          for one of these countries, I would hope that would be the case. It is interesting to see though that three countries of the group spend up more 
          than 40% of the total average spending in Military. India was an unexpected country that one may not assume to be one of these three. Although there 
          may be some data discrepancies due to the total average that was calculated since Military spending data was available up to 2019. 
        </p>
        <p>Despite the data discrepancies in terms of data availability, by drilling down into both Healthcare, Education, and Military spending analysts 
          can begin to see the overall growth of each sectors for the top G-20 countries. A story can begin to unfold with these insights that reveal 
          important trends and patterns about the data. Ultimately, we should be able to summarize what countries continue to grow in these important 
          spending categories and which countries are beginning to fall behind!

        <h2>Healthcare Summary</h2>
        <p class="lead">Healthcare is a critical need to ensure a country's population growth. Therefore, one would assume the percentage of spending 
          in healthcare would make up a decent fraction of the total GDP of a country. To confirm our assumption let's look at the Healthcare Spending 
          vs Country GDP. Then see how spending has changed over time...
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <!-- Enter Viz for Healthcare Spending Vs. Country GDP -->
        </br></br></br>
        <div id="average_healthcare_vs_gdp_div" style="width: 900px; height: 500px;"></div> </br>
        <p>On the table breakdown, we can see the overall spending in healthcare for all the countries. Surprisingly, when compared to the overall GDP of each 
          country, healthcare only makes up a small percentage. Some of the most developed countries are near the bottom like the United States and United 
          Kingdom. For the U.S. this makes sense because most healthcare spending comes from private industry and the most if not all the healthcare 
          spending by government is for <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/">Medicare</a> (federal health insurance for people 65 years of age or older) 
          or <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/">Medicaid</a> (very low-income people). It is a little odd though that the UK is so low, since most 
          European countries are known for their governments spending more, like France and Germany. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">

        </div></br>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The line graph shows much more interesting trends though of the data. Even though the United States is the 
          lowest in overall healthcare spending percentage compared to its GDP, spending is greatly increasing over time. It’s likely due to the baby boomer 
          generation of people becoming applicable for Medicare. The increasing trend is likely to continue more so with the large unemployment rate during the 
          COVID-19 pandemic forcing people to lose their employer insurance and lowering their income even more. Spending otherwise, remains to be consistent 
          with no significant increases or decreases compared to the other countries which can be viewed more closely as we interact with 
          the buttons below the chart.</p>

        <h2>Per Person Healthcare Spending</h2>
        <p class="lead">The previous visualization gives us a better idea how healthcare spending is becoming more of a priority for the US and the overall 
          trends for each country. However, the total GDP for a country is also dependent on the population of the country. To confirm that we do not 
          percieve a country spending less through the comparison of total Healthcare Spending Vs. Total GDP, let's further breakdown the metric to per 
          person spending.

        <div id="average_healthcare_per_person_div" style="width: 900px; height: 500px;"></div></br>
        <p>The table breakdown now changes some of the country standings when we look at the data from the perspective of per person. For example, China 
          was number three on the table above, but now the third to last. The UK also rose slightly higher. However, the US remains to be on the bottom 
          despite it’s increasing trend. Australia seems to care the most about its citizens when it comes to healthcare as it stands as number one for 
          overall spending and per person spending. </p>

        </div></br>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;">As we interact with each country’s spending trend per person from 2012 to 2018 on this line graph, we see the trends to be consistent 
          from 2012-2018. Therefore, we can surmise that for the most part, the countries have not increased their spending for each individual, but the 
          volume of older people receiving government subsidized medical care is increasing, especially for the United States.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
        <p>By breaking down the difference in spending from year to year for the bar chart above, we can clearly see now how countries have changed their 
          healthcare budgets over time. What’s surprising is only 4 of the 12 countries remain consistent for having a positive budget from 2012 to 2018. 
          From 2014 to 2015, eight countries decreased their spending budget, some of them significantly. This is odder since that was during the start of 
          the Ebola health crisis, therefore other external factors may have contributed such as different political stances. This was also during the 
          tense standoff between Ukraine and Crimea; therefore, Russia may have prioritized their budget in military more in this period. South Korea and 
          China are the only countries that maintain to almost a 10% increase throughout the entire time period. </p></br>
          <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Key Healtchare Insights</b></h3>
          <p>By analyzing the healthcare spending important insights can be inferred from the visualizations:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Overall spending in healthcare is increasing for most countries and is focused on the growing population. Therefore, the quality healthcare, 
              which could be inferred by the per person spending, has relatively remained to be the same since 2012.</li>
            <li>Healthcare spending remains to be a small prioritization for the top 12 G-20 countries. Data for 2019 and 2020 may change these trends 
              dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic, and hopefully there will be more growth seen in per person spending.</li>

        <h2>Education Summary</h2>
        <p class="lead">Education is another critical need to ensure a country's population and GDP growth. Therefore, one would 
          assume the percentage of spending in education would make up a sizeable fraction of the total GDP of a country. 
          Similar in our healthcare spending analysis, let’s confirm our assumption by looking at the Education Spending vs 
          Country GDP. Then breakdown how spending has changed over time.

        <div id="average_education_vs_gdp_div" style="width: 900px; height: 500px;"></div></br>
        <p>On the table breakdown, we can see the overall spending in education for all the countries. Unlike the first breakdown in healthcare, education 
          makes up a much larger overall percentage of the GDP for each country.  The United States is at the top with highest gross average of spending 
          but maintains a similar overall percentage of spending versus GDP of around 5% like all the other countries. However, there is an interesting 
          outlier in our breakdown. Saudi Arabia maintains an average of almost 24% of education spending versus it’s GDP. Upon further research into 
          this statistic, it’s been reported that the country is trying to move away it’s dependency of oil and promote higher learning of its people 
          be able to continue to modernize and become a country of technological innovation.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The line graph provides a further breakdown how countries have prioritized education from 2012 to 2016. Besides Saudi 
          Arabia standing out, which can be removed to auto-scale the graph to the other countries, the remaining line trends remain to be consistent for 
          the other countries. Interestingly, China remains to be the next highest, devoting 6% to 7% of its GDP to education. Brazil was staying around 
          the average of other countries, but in 2016 made a sharp drop to 4.2%. This may have been to different budget plans with their new president. 
          India also made a large decrease from close to 4% to 2.4% from 2013 to 2015/16. </p>

        <h2>Per Person Education Spending</h2>
        <p class="lead">The previous visualization gives us a better idea how education spending is and is not a prioritization for a country such as China or India. 
          However, the total GDP for a country is also dependent on the population of the country like we realized in our healthcare drill down. To confirm that we do not 
          percieve a country spending less through the comparison of total Education Spending Vs. Total GDP, let's further breakdown the metric to per 
          person spending as well.

        <p> Compared to our previous breakdown of per person spending using a stacked area chart for the healthcare spending, the map distribution portrays a 
          different illustration that highlights what countries are indeed prioritizing education spending. What’s immediately striking in the map is China. 
          Even though we inferred above that China’s overall percent of spending compared to GDP was above average, their actual per person spending is 
          significantly lower compared to that of other countries. However, this discrepancy could be contributed to the significant population China has 
          compared to others. The United States, Australia, and Europe remain to be in the middle. And of course, Saudi Arabia sticks out again for having a 
          significantly higher per person spending rate.</p>

          to 2016. Only China and the United States have managed for the most part to have a near-positive growth rate in education spending, but not 
          very significant. Everyone else though has some large fluctuations, especially Brazil and Russia. Seven of the twelve countries all have 
          declining growth for the latest data available indicating that their spending budgets may have other priorities than education given the current

       <p>On the table breakdown, we can see the overall spending in military for all the countries. Unlike the previous breakdowns, military spending 
         for the most part makes up a smaller average percentage of GDP compared to education, but still higher than healthcare. The United States is 
         at the top again with highest gross average of spending but maintains a similar overall percentage that hovers between 4% to close to 2%. 
         However, both the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia have a significantly higher overall percentage of GDP in military spending. Both the U.S. 
         and UK have a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, therefore it’s likely all three countries collaborate closely for military resources. </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The line graph provides another further breakdown how countries have prioritized military spending from 2012 to 
          2019. Besides the United States standing out, which can be removed to auto-scale the graph to the other countries, the remaining line trends 
          remain to be consistent for the other countries. However, China seems to be significantly increasing it’s spending since 2016. This may 
          likely be due to the latest controversy of island disputes in the South China Sea, but if their growth continues their total mean spending 
          may eventually rival the United States.</p>

        <h2>Per Person Military Spending</h2>
        <p class="lead">The previous visualization gives us a better idea how military spending is and is not a prioritization for a country. However, the 
          total GDP for a country is also dependent on the population of the country as we learned from our previous analyses in the healthcare and education 
          spending. To confirm that we do not percieve a country spending less through the comparison of total Military Spending Vs. Total GDP, let's again 
          further breakdown the metric to per person spending.

        <p>The bubble chart provides another different illustration to help depict the differences in per person military spending by growth rate compared to 
          the stacked area chart and map. Some of the immediate insights we can gain is that most of the European countries have similar average per person 
          spending as most Asian countries, but the Asian countries have a higher growth rate. Russia may have a higher per person spending average but 
          appears to be slowing its growth in spending. This maybe likely due to tensions between Ukraine and Crimea gradually easing since the military 
          spending data is more recent.  The United States is again consistent maintaining a balance of high spending per person and a slight decrease or 
          increase in growth depending on the year. And Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom have been significantly growing and increasing the average per 
          person spending.</p></br>
          <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Key Military Insights</b></h3>
          <p>By analyzing the military spending important insights can be inferred from the visualizations:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Military spending is a significant higher prioritization of spending for most G-20 countries, but not as high compared to education for others.</li>
            <li>Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom have been greatly increasing their spending in military resources.</li>
            <li>Asian countries are also seen to be increasing their growth of per person military spending which could be due to increased tension in the 
              South China Sea.</li>
          </ol>
          </br></br>
          <h2 id="end" style="text-align: center;"><b>Final Summary</b></h2>
          <p>In the beginning, we looked at a high level the total distribution between the top G-20 countries spending in healthcare, education, and military 
            from approximately 2012 to 2019. After drilling down in all the categories to carefully analyze and visualize, a story can be inferred that 
            paints a picture of prioritized investments for some of the most developed countries in the world. Most importantly, we can see how some of the 
            largest developed countries are maintaining their status based on these spending categories. Below are some of the most impactful observations 
            that may likely change how they are viewed to world and ultimately more successful. </p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>United States:</b> With the largest GDP out of all the countries, the US’s growth as remained steady over all the years. The US continues 
              to balance spending priorities in all categories and has continued to demonstrate its status as a world superpower. Compared to most of the 
              other countries, who can be seen fluctuating over certain years and for certain spending categories as world crises occur.</li>
            <li><b>Saudi Arabia:</b> The country continues to devote high prioritization in military spending equally comparable to that of the United States 
              and the United Kingdom. They also have started to significantly make education a prioritization for the country since 2012 and continue to do 
              so according the latest country budget report by KPMG <a href="https://home.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/sa/pdf/2019/KingdomofSaudi%20Arabia2020BudgetReport.pdf" 
              target="blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><b>China:</b> One of the largest most populated countries, China has a higher than average prioritization in education spending and is 
              steadily increasing it’s spending in military resources. In latest world developments, the country has been going through notable internal 
              changes with international policy and attempting to demonstrate its presence internationally through it’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic 
              (healthcare), dominance over technological advancement (education), and growing presence in the South China Sea (military).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>It’ll be certainly interesting to watch these top 3 countries evolve as the world continues to develop…</p>
